learning and trying to build something  in stochastic processes
main focus will be trying to model stochastic processes using the three body problem:
Trying to reimagine stochastic process as a push/pull response to moving gravitational elements, soon leads to less determinism
and by gicing the graph itself some sort of "mass" it quickly reaches the three body problem
